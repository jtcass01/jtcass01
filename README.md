My name is Jacob Cassady.  I work at NASA Langley Research Center in the Flight Software Systems Branch.  My current focus is autonomy; most of my time is spent as co-lead for the software and autonomy of the Tall Lunar Tower mission.

#### [SIMON - Sign Interfaced Machine Operating Network](https://github.com/jtcass01/SIMON)
This is a project that spanned a few of my undergrad courses.  I'd inject this work whenever we were free to pick the topic. The purpose of the Sign-Interfaced Machine Operating Network, or SIMON, is to develop a machine learning classifier capable of detecting a discrete set of American Sign Language (ASL) presentations from captured images of a hand and producing a desired response on another system. SIMON can utilize a variety of neural networks (nets) for producing its predictions including a classic deep neural net and a ResNet50 convolutional model.

#### [Neural Network Design](https://github.com/jtcass01/Neural-Network-Design)
Notes on the first 4 chapters of Neural Network Design by Hagan, et al. I don't plan to finish but a lot of people have found value in them.

#### [3d-tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/jtcass01/3D-Tic-Tac-Toe)
My first big project from my first programming class. Sometimes it's helpful to see how rough everyone's start is. It might look ugly; but I bet you cant beat it : )

### Select NASA Mission History
#### Tall Lunar Tower (TLT), renamed from TAALE
TAALE is a compact, lightweight, and portable, low-power self-erecting tower for use on landers, exploration rovers, and robotic lunar surface operations. Because the lunar tower is multi-functional and autonomous, it can help close two capability gaps: over horizon communications; and landing within 50 meters of a specified landing site on the Moon. This project aims to demonstrate autonomous erection of a fixed lunar infrastructure, develop systems to improve the lunar towers to support payloads, demonstrate the creation of a local WiFi network for data transfer from the top of the tower to the bottom, and demonstrate a stable platform with power and data routing for landing site survey payloads.

#### Low Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator (LOFTID)
NASA’s Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator, or LOFTID, is demonstrating a cross-cutting aeroshell -- a type of heat shield -- for atmospheric re-entry. For destinations with an atmosphere, one of the challenges NASA faces is how to deliver heavy payloads (experiments, equipment, and people) because current rigid aeroshells are constrained by a rocket’s shroud size. One answer is an inflatable aeroshell that can be deployed to a scale much larger than the shroud. This technology enables a variety of proposed NASA missions to destinations such as Mars, Venus, Titan as well as return to Earth.

#### ARCSTONE
One of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing from space is achieving required instrument calibration accuracy on-orbit. The Moon is considered to be an excellent exoatmospheric calibration source. However, the current accuracy of the Moon as an absolute reference is limited to 5 – 10%, and this level of accuracy is inadequate to meet the challenging objective of Earth Science observations. ARCSTONE is a mission concept that provides a solution to this challenge. An orbiting spectrometer flying on a small satellite in low Earth orbit will provide lunar spectral reflectance with accuracy sufficient to establish an SI-traceable absolute lunar calibration standard for past, current, and future Earth weather and climate sensors.
